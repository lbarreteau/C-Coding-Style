# C++ Coding Style

# Commits Standard

Commits must follow the following composition :

```bash
[ACTION]: description of the action to perform during the commit
```
An action can take several forms :
| Action | Description | Example |
| :----: | :---------: | :-----: |
| ADD | Added new feature, file | [ADD]: .vscode/ in gitignore |
| FIX | Fix a feature, bug | [FIX]: return value in main function |
| UPDATE | Update to get the last version | [UPDATE]: from master |
| REMOVE | Remove file, feature | [REMOVE]: Useless binary | 

**The first character of description must be small caps**
